# Recommender Systems for Amazon Electronics Products
## Purpose
In this final project for a course on machine learning, my group and I utilized k-Nearest Neighbors and Singular Value Decompisiton in creating a collaborative filtering-based recommender system to suggest electronics products to similar users on Amazon. In achieving this, we also use classical ML techniques such as Grid and Randomized Search cross validation to tune parameters and optimize our model.
## Languages
- Python (Pandas, Surprise)
## Set-Up Guide
Unfortunately, the file size is too large to upload the data directly to GitHub, but it can be found in this link from my Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jyv544TFnj453fa-Ypzo2VelpMPgCJTg?usp=share_link. In order to test run the code, download the notebook and data file, then enter the file's path directly into the notebook where specified. Or conversely, simply read the results in our report!
